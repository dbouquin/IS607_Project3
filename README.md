##Methods
Research into the history and methods of the Oscars allowed us to create 
- A [list of awards](Oscar_Award_Category.csv)
- A [list of films](Film.csv)
- [Data showing which awards were given out in which years](Film_Oscar_Award.csv)
- A [list of levels of recognition](Oscar_Award_Type.csv)

Screen-scraping methods using R libraries were used to gather:
- [BAFTA data](IS607P3 Bafta BestPicture Winner Munge AG.R)
- Winners up to 2010  
- Winners from 2011 to 2014

This resulted in untidy .csv files that represent:
- [Oscar results up to 2010](unclean_2010.csv)
- [2011-2014 Oscar results](unclean_2014.csv)

R libraries including dplyr and tidyr were used to create tidying scripts:


Data design gave us the following tools:
- A [database plan](EER_screenshot.png)
- A [database structure] project3_database_EER.mwb
